# FIFA VS Code Draw Project

### What does it do?
This is a FIFA Card Puller, designed in the same way that the card packs are in the hit game EA FC (and the lesser acclaimed EA FC Mobile). <br />
By **NO** means is this a finished product. At the very least I have many more cards and players to add, and I will also eventually do a complete overhaul of the interface and the draw animation.<br />
But for right now, please enjoy drawing your favorite footballers from the different packs!
